  - **Objective**: The study explores predictive modeling of bike-share travel times in the San Francisco Bay Area, using random forest (RF), least square boosting (LSBoost), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. With 33 predictors like distance, weather, and time of day, RF models achieved the best performance (MAE: 84.01 seconds; MAPE: 16.92%). Key factors affecting travel time include travel distance, subscription type, time of day, weekends, temperature, and humidity. The research highlights RF's superiority and emphasizes weather's role in bike travel time variability.
  - **Methods**: To develop the most accurate travel time prediction model, several statistical and machine learning techniques were evaluated. Initially, multiple linear regression (MLR) was employed as a baseline approach. Subsequently, advanced machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), least square boosting (LSBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANN), were investigated. These techniques were systematically compared to identify the most accurate model. This section outlines the methodologies applied to analyze the data.
  - **Outcomes**: Random forest (RF) models outperformed other techniques, including LSBoost and ANN, in predicting bike travel time. Using RF and forward stepwise regression, the key predictors identified were travel distance, subscription type, time-of-day, Saturday, mean temperature, mean humidity, and Sunday. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, were also found to significantly impact bike travel time.
  - **Relation to the Project**: In the BSS even though the data was limited to stations and service areas the main study and methodolgy was focused on bicycle travel time. Further the models used in this paper can be tested with our data set considering the variables used are same.
