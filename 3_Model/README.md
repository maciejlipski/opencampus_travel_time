# Model Definition and Evaluation

## Model Selection
After the baseline model, final model was focused on predicting cycling speed and subsequently, the time taken for a route. To achieve this, two models are employed:
- Linear Regression (LR): This serves as the baseline model, representing a simpler approach. It assumes a linear relationship between the features (elevation, slope, etc.) and the target variable (speed). It's pre-trained and loaded from a file. This model provides a benchmark for comparison with more complex approaches.
